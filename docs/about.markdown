I graduated from the Ho Chi Minh University of Technology with a major in Electrical and Communication Engineering. Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering (neuroscience). I have strong skills in python and Matlab programming, especially in data analysis, machine learning, biomedical signal processing, and deep learning. I am also willing to learn new skills and knowledge to accomplish my work as best as possible.
